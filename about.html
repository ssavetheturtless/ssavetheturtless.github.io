        <div class="columns-text-box dark">I spent a few years in a  village on the Thai-Burma border region, working and living with the Karen ethnic group of Karen State, Burma. Many of my students and friends come from deep mountain villages in Karen State or from one of several refugee camps on the Thai-side of the border, set up as &#x27;temporary&#x27; settlements as they fled persecution from the Burmese military—over thirty years have since passed. There, I taught at Thoo Mweh Khee Learning Center (TMK) as a Lecturer in their university program (Bachelor of Liberal Arts, BLA). TMK has over 900 students, many of whom also live in one of the dorms around what has now become a medium-sized village centered around the school.</div>
        <div class="columns-text-box dark">Seeing the Karen&#x27;s prolonged plight in uncertainty, I saw the shortcomings of the international community. Resource scarcity and the ebbs and flows of politics constantly re-prioritizes the IC&#x27;s growing list of to-do&#x27;s, leaving many issues unresolved and others neglected all together. This is only natural, given the unavoidable politics and economics at the nation-state and global level. But, I wonder if there are better ways to more efficiently deploy the resources of the IC and its various actors, thereby more effectively working on issues seemingly local, but entirely global in impact.</div>

              <h3 class="heading-3">&quot;I could be bound in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space&quot;<br><br>— Hamlet</h3>
              <div class="text-block-5">By data, I am referring to a committment to finding and following what realities are present. It&#x27;s being open to challenges to my perceptions and my understandings, though not a committment to absolute objectivity (whatever that means). Data can come in forms familiar, like number of students at a migrant school and number increase year over year. It could also be qualitative, like the student responses to why they chose to attend this specific migrant school this specific year. Or, a more broad, yet personal question: what does your image of peace and stability look like, post conflict resolutions? These are some questions I&#x27;ve posed to my students at TMK and some data that we tracked over the years. In the development space, having a basis of data, of certain baseline realities, is quite important and it&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t realize until living in the &quot;field,&quot; that is with the community on the receiving end of aid. <br><br>Many enter without this baseline, or maybe incorrect or insufficient data, and are instead equipped with only personal perceptions and no intentions of testing them. Without mechanisms to evaluate implemented programs, money and aid tends to be slightly off target. On the receiving end, I saw the students and leaders hesitant to make suggestions, grateful for the effort. The off-balance power dynamics are clearly present, which is why there is greater need for practitioners, researchers, and those wielding this power—whether willinginly or not—to commit to truly understanding the space and the needs.</div>

              <h2 class="heading-2">development</h2>
              <h3 class="heading-3">&quot; &quot;<br><br>— Hamlet</h3>
              <div class="text-block-5">Both data and design pervade all industries and fields. I am interested in their application in the field of development. My focus is on the Global South, formerly colonized states, or states with a low Human Development Index (HDI), but more specifically regions and populations that have been neglected or where aid agencies&#x27; focus has otherwise seemingly been put on hold. I am particularly interested in the idea of scarcity when it comes to development and humanitarian programs. That is, scarcity in human, political, and economic capital from the West. The West (or countries with high HDI, more accurately) has adopted a sense of responsibility for pulling other countries out of poverty, conflict, or other states of instability. (The discourse on this sense of responsibility versus ghosts of colonization is vast and is not being neglected here, though I will avoid placing caveats, stipulations, and pontifications in every other sentence. Please do keep that in mind. I am also not completely read into the depths of the discourse, so I would be wise to maintain some distance.) However, the West and its individual actors only have a limited amount of practical resources. Money, I think is low on this list; there is plenty of that to go around. Rather, the political capital to direct that money is scarce and politicians, policymakers, and other actors must be shrewd.<br><br>This isn&#x27;t a pretty picture, but it&#x27;s a fact of society, perhaps more so in stable democracies where the game of politics rewards the clever and cunning over the purely altruistic. <strong>How, then, can this scarcity be optimized to maximize benefits?</strong> First, is to reduce waste. This notion has become popular and efforts at reducing wasteful spending by aid agencies have increased. Rigorous evaluations and evaluation methods are being explored and transparency (at least, calls for) is becoming a standard practice. <br><br>The next step is to outsource. That is, to put the onus on the local communities, the individuals living in those states. The reason here is twofold. First, they know best. Not only do they know their local context better, they know what they want their future to look like, too. But, that scares certain stakeholders because they then have to forfeit a lot of the power. <br><br>Putting the onus on local communities doesn&#x27;t mean  having them figure things out on their own or to fend for themselves. It&#x27;s to equip them with what&#x27;s necessary while refraining from imposing certain directives or direction. This is giving them more than a voice, but a say—agency. This is what I&#x27;m interested in exploring. Rather than preaching democracy or giving step-by-step formulae for building our society inside theirs, let them pick and choose. The end result may look very similar to ours, but its nuances will be the cornerstones that keeps it all up in their context. Resilience, in that sense, cannot be imported, but must be organic, native to the local context. As such, it becomes an act of regeneration, healing from the exploitative colonial pasts, from which can come a more generative future.</div>

              <h2 class="heading-2">Design</h2>
              <h3 class="heading-3">&quot;Code is never neutral. But it is a reflection of the aspirations, hopes, fears, and world views of its creators&quot;<br><br>— Jan Chipchase, &quot;Sustainable Data&quot;</h3>
              <div class="text-block-5">In many ways, design is the thought behind the entire lifecycle of a program or project, from brainstorming to implementation and evaluation. Design is how the implementors interpret then manifest the data. From visual design to policy design, design is rather broad, and I&#x27;ve intentionally kept it so for my purposes. <br><br>But, all types are founded on the same approach of design thinking. A part of this framework is to bring the data closer to its origins. Rather than viewing data as only a variable or an observation through one&#x27;s computer screen, it is acknowledging, then trying to understand, that the data is usually an abstraction, a few degrees removed from the living, feeling, and thinking soul. Of course, the data is accurate, but it is also static, a snapshot—even when looking at trends. From here, the role—and responsibility—of researchers and practitioners is to &quot;take that empathy and [...] reflect it back on them through your work.&quot; [1] <br></div><img src="images/Line---Light.png" loading="lazy" width="295" alt="">
