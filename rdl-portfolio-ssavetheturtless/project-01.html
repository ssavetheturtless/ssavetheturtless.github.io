      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>This project aims to preserve and present the culture of the Karen people through an online museum. For decades, Karen has been in conflict with the government, and more specifically, the military, of Myanmar, which has brought instability to the lifestyle of the Karen and insecurity regarding the future of Karen, as an ethnic group with a specific culture as well as for individuals. Through the United Nations and many welcoming countries, the Karen people have been relocated throughout the world as refugees. The first goal of this project is to connect this population. Cultural preservation in this regard incorporates exposing the scattered Karen to their culture, which many of the new generation are distant from. This is where our second goal comes in. The collection and presentation of this culture will be led and performed by Karen students who have remained within their culture and land. With a focus on empowerment and agency, this projects hopes give the students of Karen the opportunity to represent their culture.<br><br>As museums grapple with the ethics of their collections, the narrative of this museum will be written by the Karen themselves. Using augmented reality in some exhibits, there will be interactive components to this museum, bringing people closer to this culture. As an ethnic group that endured human rights violations and scattered across the globe because of it, the museum will serve as a space of unification, transcending distance and current museum trends.<br><br>The museum project will be conducted with three main grounding principles that will serve as a guiding framework for operations. (1) Seek and establish local experts, (2) heed local stewardship, and (3) include Karen students. These principles are in place to embed empowerment and agency to the very core of this project, giving ownership of this project and of their narrative to the Karen.<br><br>The data here is almost entirely qualitative to start. Some ideas that we have are:collecting visitor data through surveys and crossing that with data on There is a future, related project that will be holding a census. For safety reasons, this has been put on hold. This has the potential of helping Karen leaders implement policies and negotiate more effectively. designdevelopment</p>
      <h4>‍<strong>Background</strong></h4>
      <p class="paragraph-25">This project came about rather organically in one of my classes at Thoo Mweh Khee (TMK). The class was Politics: Active Citizenship, a 2nd-Year (sophomore) course for students in our university-level program. The syllabus had a few readings and a textbook published under the Creative Commons license. I structured the course, however, to follow the lifecycle of a social, environmental, or political program. (Active citizenship in Burma for Karen students has different emphases than it does is more legitimate democracies.) The students were to create a program and implement it as well, applying what they learn directly into their community. The programs and projects that the students envisioned ranged from planting more trees on their campus to petitioning leaders of their villages to stop taking money from the Burmese military, the Tatmadaw, who were taking down fields of trees, and start protecting their natural resources and the environment.<br><br>Most projects, however, had themes of showcasing different parts of life as a Karen, from traditional instruments and dance to cuisine in the the jungles. As the students developed their projects in groups and began to implement them, interest around these cultural projects began to grow as the students travelled to seek out experts in their chosen project. My students, who had grown up almost entirely in Burma then on the Thai-Burma region (in camps or at TMK), found that they themselves were learning so much and began to wonder if they could get this out to other Karen students abroad and interested foreign audiences. What they were describing was a cross between a museum and the work of a particular department within an embassy. And so, the Karen Virtual Museum project was born.<br></p>
